 **What is Markdown?**  
 It's a way of telling a computer how you want it to format text. It works well for writing basic website content because it is simple and reliable. It may 

**Why do I need to use it?**  
Because the "Prose" Content Editor that you'll use to update the {% include config/target-website-name %} website uses it.  


 **How much do I need to know?**  
 Just enough to format your content so that it fits in with existing content on the {% include config/target-website-name %} website. If you _really want_ to do something more fancy, try googling for 'Markdown Syntax'.


**It's as simple as this...**

+ Write out the text of your content.
+ To make a paragraph break at the end of a sentence, hit return twice.
+ To make a word or phrase **bold** use asterisks  \*\*like this\*\*.
+ To make a word or phrase _italic_ use underscores  \_like this\_.
+ To make a header use two or more hashes like this: ## Big Header, ### Smaller Header. The results will be like this...  

## Big Header  

### Smaller Header  
<br/>


+ Be sure to leave a space between the hashes and the header or it won't work. You can use up to five hashes.
<br/>  

+ To make bullet points put a cross in front of each 'point' like this...  
\+ point 1    
\+ point 2  
\+ point 3
