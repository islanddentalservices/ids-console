+ A crown is a type of cap that completely covers a real tooth.
+ It's made from either metal, or porcelain and metal, and is fixed in your mouth.
+ Crowns can be fitted where a tooth has broken, decayed or been damaged, or just to make a tooth look better.
+ To fit a crown, the old tooth will need to be drilled down so it's like a small peg the crown will be fixed onto.
+ It can take some time for the lab to prepare a new crown, so you probably won't have the crown fitted on the same day.
