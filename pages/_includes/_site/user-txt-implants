+ Implants are a fixed alternative to removable dentures. They may be the only option if the loss of teeth has caused the mouth to shrink so that it can no longer support dentures.

+ Implants can replace just a single tooth or several teeth.

+ To fit an implant, titanium screws are drilled into the jaw bone to support a crown, bridge or denture.

+ Replacement parts take time to prepare. This is to ensure that they fit your mouth and other teeth properly. Therefore, they may not be available on your first visit to the dentist.
