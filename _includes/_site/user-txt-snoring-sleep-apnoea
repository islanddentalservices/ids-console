+ We are part of a national network of dentists trained to provide comprehensive diagnosis and treatment for snorers and Sleep Apnoea sufferers.

+ As such, we can offer the most clinically proven Sleep Apnoea treatment - the **Sleepwell** Mandibular Advancement Splint

+ Sleep Apnoea may have serious consequences. Sufferers wake repeatedly at night because their airway has become blocked. They may experience daytime tiredness, reduced memory, irritability or loss of sex drive.

+ Worse still, persistent lack of oxygen to the brain may result in chronic metabolic stress and increased vulnerability to disorders like diabetes, obesity, short-term memory impairment and brain dysfunction.
