+ Island Dental Services was established by the Principal, Dr Keith Tierney in 1986. We are a fully private clinic. 

+ We have three operating rooms with 2 Dentists and 1 Hygienist. We offer treatments in all of the dental specialities except  for advanced child orthodontics and  Implants for which we refer. 

+ Our Philosophy is to provide the best possible service by treating you as a whole person and taking the necessary time to do this. We understand that everyone is unique with different financial abilities and clinical needs. We adopt primarily a preventive approach use the finest materials and employ the most appropriate techniques.

+ Nervous Patients- We understand that for some, even the thought of making a dental appointment can cause palpitations! Do tell our Receptionist if you are nervous and she will make sure you are helped in every way possible. It’s quite normal to be offered tea and sympathy before you see the dentist (even if you are not nervous) you will be directed towards a dentist who is highly sympathetic and highly trained. On your first appointment (which is basically an information gathering exercise) the different treatment approaches will be discussed with you. These can include the use of anxiety reducing drugs, Reflexology, Homeopathy and Clinical Hypnosis.

+ Children- Presently all children’s checkups are done by the dentists. 

+ Adults- All new patients are directed to the dentist who has special interests in areas most appropriate to your needs.

+ Materials- We try 5 star rated products which are independently scientifically assessed and pick the best. There is NO cost compromise with our dental materials.
