+ The pencil button(s) below will open the "Prose" website content editor.  

+ When you get into Prose, press the green button ( bottom right of the screen) before you do any editing. If you edit without logging in, your changes will be lost!

+ If you have got into Prose and you can't see the green button that means you are already logged in, so go ahead and edit.

+ It is possible that you could get a message saying "403 Forbidden - API rate limit exceeded" when you open Prose. **Ignore it and log in.** You would see this message if you had looked at a lot of pages without using the green button to log into Prose. This is a security measure to deter spammers and suchlike from using Prose's servers.
